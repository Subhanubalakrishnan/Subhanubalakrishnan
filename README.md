## 🔭 Projects

### Electronic Watch Dog
Developed a security system for small retail shops using an ultrasonic sensor, **Arduino**, and a buzzer. The system detects unauthorized entry and triggers an audible alert to enhance shop security.

### Analysis of Abdominal Signal in Fetal Monitoring using Deep Learning
Designed a wearable device for fetal monitoring that uses **Deep Learning** and **Cloud Computing** to analyze and classify fetal movements. The system provides real-time insights for early detection of fetal distress.
